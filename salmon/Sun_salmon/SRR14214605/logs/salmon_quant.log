[2023-05-15 18:57:38.276] [jointLog] [info] Counted 25,874,691 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2023-05-15 18:57:38.277] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00953106% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
