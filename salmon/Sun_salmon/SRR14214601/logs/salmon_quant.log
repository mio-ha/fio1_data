[2023-05-15 18:46:15.315] [jointLog] [info] Counted 20,534,039 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2023-05-15 18:46:15.316] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00939945% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
